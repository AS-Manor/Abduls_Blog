HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the fundamental technologies of Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page and CSS beautifies it.

## HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

it stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
it is the standard markup language for creating web pages
it describes the structure of a web page
it consists of a series of elements
the elements tell the browser how to display the content

```diff-html
<!-- this is a simple html document -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

it stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
It is used to format the layout of a webpage.
With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

CSS can be added to HTML in different ways

One way is by using the;

```diff-css
<style></style> // using the style tag in the head section.
<link> // and by using link when the css file is external.
```
